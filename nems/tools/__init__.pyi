'''
A collection of miscellaneous utility functions.

TODO: Anything that used to be in nems.utils.py should go in this directory,
with functions of similar purpose grouped in modules. Even if there's just
one function that belongs in a solo group, it should *not* just be dumped in
'misc' or 'etc' or a similarly named file with other one-offs.
